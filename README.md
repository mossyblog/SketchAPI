# Sketch API

This is a prototype Javascript API for Sketch.

The intention is to make something which is:

- native Javascript
- an easily understandable subset of the full internals of Sketch
- fully supported by Bohemian between releases (ie we try not to change it, unlike our internal API which we can and do change whenever we need to)
- still allows you to drop down to our internal API when absolutely necessary.

Comments and suggestions for this API are welcome - send them to developers@sketchapp.com.

## Install

The API comes bundled inside Sketch, so no installation is required.

## Usage

Example script:

```
var sketch = context.api()

log(sketch.api_version)
log(sketch.version)
log(sketch.build)
log(sketch.full_version)


var document = sketch.frontDocument;
var selection = document.selection;
var page = document.selectedPage;

var group = page.newGroup({frame:sketch.rectangle(0, 0, 100, 100), name:"Test"});
var rect = group.newShape({frame:sketch.rectangle(10, 10, 80, 80)});

log(selection.is_empty());
selection.iterate(function(item) { log(item.name); } );

selection.clear();
log(selection.is_empty());

group.select();
rect.add_to_selection();

sketch.input("Test", "default");
sketch.select("Test", ["One", "Two"], 1);
sketch.message("Hello mum!");
sketch.alert("Title", "message");
```

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank:

- [Andrey Shakhmin](https://github.com/turbobabr), for his inspiration during the [Hamburg Hackathon](http://designtoolshackday.com), where he showed us how to use node modules inside Sketch.
- The Sketch plugin community everywhere, for such awesome work.

## Development

If you want to build the library locally, you need to run this on the project's root folder (this assumes you already have [node](https://nodejs.org) installed):

```
npm install -g gulp
npm install
```

Once that's ready, you can run:

```
gulp
```

to compile the library. By default, it will be saved to `../SketchPluginManager/Source/SketchAPI.js`. You can specify your own output path by using the `--output` argument:

```
gulp --output Output/SketchAPI.js
```

To have Sketch use the .js file you just built, you can run this:

```
defaults write ~/Library/Preferences/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3.plist SketchAPILocation "/path/to/SketchAPI.js"
```

and Sketch will load the external .js file instead of the bundled version.

### Testing

TBD
